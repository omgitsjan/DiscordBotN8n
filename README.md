# DiscordBotN8n - Starter C# Discord Bot powerd by n8n

This is a modern C# Discord bot powered by [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) and orchestrated with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) for flexible, extendable (AI) workflows.  
Responses are generated by an AI agent via n8n, and you have one simple **/aiagent** command that gives you the full power of connected tools - language, image, or automation, depending on your n8n flow.

If you prefer a plug-and-play solution without n8n, a standalone hosted version of the bot is also available at **https://github.com/omgitsjan/DiscordBotAiStarter**.

## Features
- **AI chat command** (`/aiagent`) - connect to your own n8n workflows, leveraging OpenAI and any other n8n tools in one command
- **Ping command** (`/ping`) - check bot latency and uptime
- Easily extensible for custom flows or plugins
- Full Docker and local development support

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Discord bot token
- An n8n workflow URL (Webhook) and API key
- [.NET 8+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Docker (optional, for containerized runs)

	`git clone https://github.com/omgitsjan/DiscordBotN8n.git`
	`cd DiscordBotN8n`
	` dotnet restore`
	`dotnet build`

2.  Copy `appsettings.Template.json` to `appsettings.json`.
3.  Edit `appsettings.json` and fill in your credentials:

          "AiAgentWorkflowUrl":"<Your n8n Webhook URL>"
       }
    }

4.  Run the bot:
    `dotnet run`

## Docker

An official image is published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/omgitsjan/discordbotn8n):

Send any prompt to your n8n-powered AI agent.  
Example:

    /aiagent What tools do you have?

**/ping**  
Check bot latency and uptime.  
Example:

    /ping
