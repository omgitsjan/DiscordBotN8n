## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[mail@janpetry.de](mailto:mail@janpetry.de)**. You will receive a response from
me within 72 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
